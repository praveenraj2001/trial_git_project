<Connect to the Github>
* Create new repo 

# git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/trial_git_project.git
* remote command link local repo to the remote Git repo and the name of that is origin

# git remote -v
* used to verify weather fetch and push happens to the remote repo

# git remote set-url origin https://praveenraj2001:<PAT>@github.com/praveenraj2001/trial_git_project.git
* connects the local repo with github online using https

# git push -u origin master
* -u This means that when you use the git push or git pull command in the future without specifying a remote or branch, Git will know to push or pull from the branch master on the origin remote.

<> a .gitignore when some files or folders are add into this they are not tracked by git or github


<Below we learn branching and mearging the branch>

# git checkout -b feature/uart-driver
* here this will create a branch feature/uart-driver and will checkout to that branch

# git checkout feature/uart-driver
* we can use this just to checkout to this branch (if this branch already exists)

<modify the required files>

# git add src/uart.c inc/uart.h

# git commit -m "added UART driver skeleton"

# git push -u origin feature/uart-driver

<> create a pull request in the github

<merging through cmd line>

# git pull origin master 
* if there are any new changes update the current code with that (update local with changes in remote)

# git checkout master

# git merge feature/uart-driver

# git push -u origin master

# git log
* when this is used then the top item will be

    add UART driver skeleton

* here there are two branches master and feature/uart-driver so that means the commit is either common to both or the branch has been merged

<Below we will tackle the Merge conflict>

# git checkout -b feature/logging
(make changes to main.c and commit - create a PR)
# git add src/main.c
# git commit -m "enabled Logging"
# git push -u origin feature/logging
# git checkout master
# git merge feature/logging 
* usually instead of merging directly create a Pull request - when working in a team

# git checkout -b feature/debug
(edit the same file just change same value in both branches and commit - create a PR) 
# git add src/main.c
# git commit -am "Debug is enabled"
# git push -u origin feature/debug
# git checkout master
# git merge feature/debug

* here you will see the below message
"""
Auto-merging src/main.c
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/main.c
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
"""

# git checkout master
# git merge feature/logging
* the above merges and puts them in staging area

# git merge feature/debug
* now here you will see merge conflict

<> git commit -am "message"
* the above will stage and commit with this message while -m will only commit
